# LiquidTelecom-AddIns


The features include:
 
    - Locating the first empty cell on the Serial Numbers Column. (this feature also works with a partially competed document.)
    - Fetching Serial Numbers, Calculating the price to be charged on the customer while putting into consideration the condition by which  we charge for labour.
    - Locating the first empty cell when SUBMIT is pressed
    - Creating a new Row if SUBMIT is pressed when the last row in the Table is occupied.
    
NOTE: This addIn has to be installed into your excel and you also need to create Net Tab where you will add the "Quotation" Macro on the ribbons. This feature also needs you to have your "Price Lookup" Sheet in the same sheet as the quotation otherwise edit the code as required.
